                    The sun is an ordinary star, one of about 100 billion in our
                    galaxy, the Milky Way. The sun has extremely important
                    influences on our planet: It drives weather, ocean currents,
                    seasons, and climate, and makes plant life possible through
                    photosynthesis. Without the sun’s heat and light, life on
                    Earth would not exist. About 4.5 billion years ago, the sun
                    began to take shape from a molecular cloud that was mainly
                    composed of hydrogen and helium. A nearby supernova emitted
                    a shockwave, which came in contact with the molecular cloud
                    and energized it. The molecular cloud began to compress, and
                    some regions of gas collapsed under their own gravitational
                    pull. As one of these regions collapsed, it also began to
                    rotate and heat up from increasing pressure. Much of the
                    hydrogen and helium remained in the center of this hot,
                    rotating mass. Eventually, the gases heated up enough to
                    begin nuclear fusion, and became the sun in our solar
                    system.

                  <p style="text-align: justify">
                    Named for the fleet-footed Roman messenger god, Mercury is
                    the closest planet to the sun, zipping around our parent
                    star at an average of 36 million miles away. However,
                    Mercury’s orbit is not a perfect circle. The planet can pass
                    as close as 29 million miles and as far away as 43 million
                    miles. Living up to its name, Mercury is the fastest planet
                    in the solar system, speeding along at about 29 miles per
                    second and completing each orbit around the sun in just 88
                    Earth days. Mercury is also the smallest planet in the solar
                    system, measuring just 3,032 miles wide at its equator. That
                    makes it only slightly larger than Earth’s moon.

                  <p style="text-align: justify">
                    If we couldn’t see Venus, we’d hardly dare to imagine such a
                    deceptive world. Named for the Roman goddess of love and
                    fertility, the planet is one of the nighttime sky’s most
                    beautiful sights. But up close, Venus smells like rotting
                    eggs. Its raindrops would dissolve flesh, and at its
                    surface, temperatures are hot enough that wood and gasoline
                    would spontaneously burst into flame, while the pressure is
                    so high that submarines would crumple. Though today’s Venus
                    is grotesque, scientists suspect it was once quite
                    different—temperate, perhaps awash in oceans, maybe even
                    inhabited. For billions of years, our solar system may have
                    been home to two blue marbles orbiting the sun, side by
                    side. Yet while life on Earth flourished and thrived, a
                    catastrophic amount of carbon accumulated in Venus’s
                    atmosphere, triggering a runaway greenhouse effect that laid
                    waste to our once-verdant sibling. Now Venus is a deadly
                    marble—a world gone wrong.
